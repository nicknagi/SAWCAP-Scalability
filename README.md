## Coding Guidelines

* Most of the codebase is in Python. Let us try to use Python for most of our work unless required otherwise. This reduces mental overhead when context switching between different languages.

* Follow the Python PEP8 coding style guidelines. This ensures consisteny in the codebase. Major points to keep in mind:

        Snake case for variables: this_is_a_variable = 5

        Class names use camel case: ClassName

        Be descriptive with names: instead of x = 5 -- use number_of_machines = 5 etc.
